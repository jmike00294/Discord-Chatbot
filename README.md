# ChatGPT Discord Bot

This is a simple Discord bot that integrates with OpenAI's GPT model (text-davinci-002) to respond to user questions. It uses the `discord.py` and `openai` libraries, and reads API keys from environment variables using a `.env` file.

## Features

- Responds to prompts using the `!ask` command.
- Powered by OpenAI's `text-davinci-002` model.
- Loads secrets securely from a `.env` file.
- Basic error handling for invalid commands.
